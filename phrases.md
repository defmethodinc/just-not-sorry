      <ul>
        <li>"Yes, but"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>The "Yes, but" syndrome is entirely counterproductive, particularly in a work setting. You will become an
      integral part of any team if you are willing to build ideas rather than discard them. --Victoria Simon, Ph.D. and
      Holly Pedersen, Ph.D. <a

      <ul>
        <li>"Literally"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>If something is literal, your readers should know it without you needing to use this word to clarify it. More
      often than not, the word "literally" makes writing sound flabby and juvenile, which is probably not what you're
      going for. --Julia McCoy <a

      completely. --Andrea Ayres <a href="http://blog.crew.co/5-weak-words-to-avoid/" rel="noopener noreferrer"

        <li>"Did this make sense"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>"does that make sense" comes across either as condescending (like your audience can't understand) or it implies
      you feel you've been incoherent. A better way to close is something like "I look forward to hearing your
      thoughts." You can leave it up to the other party to let you know if they are confused about something, rather
      than implying that you "didn't make sense." --Tara Sophia Mohr <a

      <ul>
        <li>"I should"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>The word "should" is inherently negative. "Should" implies a lose: lose situation and it's just not conducive to
      positive outcomes in life. It's a form of criticism, and it's best left out of your everyday language. Instead of
      beating yourself up for what you should have done, focus on what you have the power to change. -- Zoe B <a

        <li>"We feel"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>Phrases containing "we believe," "we think," and "we feel" pervade presentation narratives to such a degree that
      they spill over into sentences where caution is unnecessary...the spillage weakens what should otherwise be
      assertive language. --Jerry Weissman <a href="https://hbr.org/2011/12/replace-meaningless-words-with"
                                              rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">source</a></td>

    <th>
      <ul>
        <li>"I'm just saying"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>I think what you're saying is that you said something. If you're using it to mitigate something that may be
      offensive or embarrassing, then don't say it. Say something else. Otherwise, say what you're saying without the
      "just saying." We already know you're saying it... after all, you just said it! --Robert Bruce <a

    <th>
      <ul>
        <li>"In my opinion"</li>
      </ul>
    </th>
    <td>Phrases such as "in my opinion," "I think that," and "I believe" create three problems for writers: 1. They
      delay the writer's message; 2. They demonstrate insecurity; and 3. They tell the reader what he already knows.
      Remove that phrase, or any similar phrase, and get to the point. --David Bowman <a
